***********************************
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.7.1

NEW FEATURES

   o Add new stepwise option "merge_persample". Migth be useful in some case to merge the different samples and remove the duplicates if specified in the config files. This step is also run in the "build_contact_map" steps, before generating the contact maps.

   o Can now generate raw contact maps at the restriction fragment resolution (build_matrix v1.2). To do so, specified a BIN_SIZE=-1. Note that in pratice ICE will be run on these matrices too although its assumption of the equal visibility across bins may require further exploration in the present case.

   o New version of the iced package 0.2.1

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o Change in the calculation of insert size distribution. The length of DNA fragment after ligation are now calculated using the read start. In the previous version, we used the middle of the read as starting point. The insert size was therefore shifted by a factor equal to the read length

   o ALLELE_SPECIFIC_SNP file will be detected using the full absolute path or in the annotation folder

   o R1 and R2 reads are now ordered by genomic position in the validPairs files. This might have an impact on the duplicates level

NEW FEATURES

   o New parameters - FILTER_HIGH_COUNT_PERC / FILTER_LOW_COUNT_PERC to filter out extreme count before normalization. Note that the parameter SPARSE_FILTERING is now deprecated and replaced by FILTER_LOW_COUNT_PERC

   o New utility ; digest_genome.py which take a fasta file and the name(s) or sequence(s) of the restriction enzyme(s) in order to generate the list of restriction fragments after genome digestion. 

   o HiC-Pro is now able to process data generate from protocols without restriction enzyme such as DNase Hi-C. See the manual for more information

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

   o The mapping step2 is now optional and will be run only if the ligation site is specified

   o New parameter MIN_CIS_DIST in order to discard all contacts below the specified distance. This is mainly used for DNase Hi-C to remove artefact which are likely to be self ligation product.
